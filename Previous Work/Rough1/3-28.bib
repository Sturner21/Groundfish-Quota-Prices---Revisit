	abstract = {This research focuses on the sector management program regulating the northeast multispecies (groundfish) fishery. Sector management is a type of catch share program in which quota (called Annual Catch Entitlement, or “ACE”) is allocated annually to groups known as “sectors” that operate similarly to harvest cooperatives. In a manner similar to that of other catch share program reviews, this report uses social network analysis to examine ACE trading within the northeast groundfish fishery. The primary purpose of this analysis is to begin to explore patterns in how ACE moves between groundfish sectors. Specifically, this report attempts to: (1) characterize the structure and composition of the groundfish ACE transfer network, (2) track changes in network metrics over time, and (3) identify which sectors occupy various positions in the groundfish ACE transfer network. This paper provides background information about groundfish management and a general treatment of social network analysis methods. In the final 2 sections, findings from the network analysis are reported and followed by study conclusions and recommendations for further research.},

	abstract = {Several studies have documented fish populations changing in response to long-term warming. Over the past decade, sea surface temperatures in the Gulf of Maine increased faster than 99\% of the global ocean. The warming, which was related to a northward shift in the Gulf Stream and to changes in the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation and Pacific Decadal Oscillation, led to reduced recruitment and increased mortality in the region’s Atlantic cod (
              Gadus morhua
              ) stock. Failure to recognize the impact of warming on cod contributed to overfishing. Recovery of this fishery depends on sound management, but the size of the stock depends on future temperature conditions. The experience in the Gulf of Maine highlights the need to incorporate environmental factors into resource management.

              In the best of worlds, exploited fish stocks are monitored so that harvest quotas protect the reproductive ability of the population. Climate change is likely to complicate this process substantially. Pershing
              et al.
              found that cod stocks declined continuously during intense warming in the North Atlantic. Fisheries quotas, even though they were responsibly set and followed by fishers, decreased the reproductive rate. Thus, managing fisheries in a warming world is going to be increasingly problematic.

            Failure to account for the impacts of climate and ecosystem change on stock dynamics can introduce uncertainty to stock assessments that can make meeting the objective of sustainable fisheries management challenging. The increased prevalence and magnitude of uncertainty in New England groundfish stock assessments (i.e. retrospective patterns) in recent years suggest that there may be common drivers impacting these stocks that are currently unaccounted for in the stock assessment. We examined the coherence in retrospective patterns across groundfish stock assessments and evaluated candidate drivers of retrospective patterns, including large-scale climate and ecosystem change, as well as significant management and monitoring changes. We found high coherence in moving window Mohn's rho time series for groundfish within the Gulf of Maine and Georges Bank areas. Fluctuations in Gulf of Maine groundfish Mohn's rho values were most strongly related to lagged bottom temperature and spiny dogfish biomass time series, whereas fluctuations in Georges Bank groundfish Mohn's rho values were strongly related to lagged time series of warm core rings formation from the Gulf Stream. Our identification of coherence in retrospective patterns across groundfish stocks by region supports the idea of common regional drivers with climate and ecosystem changes emerging as the leading contributing factors.},

              The northern shrimp
              Pandalus borealis
              is at its southern limit in the Gulf of Maine (
              GOM
              ), and recruitment success is higher in years with relatively cool water temperature. However, the mechanisms for the temperature effect are not clear. We used rolling window analysis of daily satellite data to identify critical periods for early life survival of the 1998–2012 northern shrimp year‐classes and to investigate the importance of the phenology of the hatch and bloom. Survival was negatively correlated with sea surface temperature (
              SST
              ) during a 6‐week period around the time of larval emergence (late winter) and during a 4‐week period in late summer when
              SST
              and stratification reached annual maxima. Survival was negatively correlated with chlorophyll‐
              a
              concentration (chl‐
              a
              ) during two 5‐week periods centered approximately a month before the hatch midpoint and around the time of settlement to the benthos. A small‐magnitude winter bloom occurred around the time of the hatch in many years, but our results did not reveal a link between survival and bloom‐hatch phenology. The timing of winter and spring blooms were correlated with
              SST
              during the preceding 10 months. A survival model including
              SST
              and chl‐
              a
              during the critical periods explained 73\% of the variance in survival. Summer
              SST
              increased significantly during the study period; the other critical variables showed no trend. The rolling windows approach revealed sensitive periods in early life history that may not have otherwise been hypothesized, providing a foundation for research towards a greater understanding of processes affecting recruitment.},

	abstract = {The Northeast Multispecies Fishery, referred to as the groundfish fishery, is managed by the New England Fishery Management Council (NEFMC). The groundfish fishery is carried out using both fixed and trawl gears.4 The groundfish resource is distributed throughout waters of the Gulf of Maine (GOM) and Georges Bank (GB) and, to a lesser extent, Southern New England (SNE) and the Mid-Atlantic Bight. Prior to Fishing Year 2010, the groundfish fishery was primarily managed using effort controls, including Days at Sea (DAS) and trip limits. Amendment 13 to the groundfish Fishery Management Plan (FMP) was implemented in May 2004; it redefined initial allocations of DAS and allowed vessels to engage in DAS leasing and DAS transfers under certain conditions. Amendment 13 also introduced the “Sector Allocation” program, which gave fishermen the opportunity to voluntarily form “sectors”, or groups of fishing vessels that would be allotted a share (quota) of the total Annual Catch Limit (ACL) for groundfish stocks. The fishing activity of sectors would be constrained by quotas rather than DAS. Sectors could request exemptions from many of the traditional input controls such as trip limits. In July 2004, the Georges Bank Hook Gear Sector was authorized and assigned an allocation for Georges Bank cod. The second sector, the Georges Bank Cod Fixed Gear Sector, was authorized and assigned a Georges Bank cod allocation in May 2007. This set the stage for Amendment 16 to the Northeast Multispecies FMP, which implemented a catch share program on May 01, 2010.},

              Ongoing climate change is affecting the concentration, export (flux), and timing of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) exported to the Gulf of Maine (GoM) through changes in hydrologic regime. DOC export was calculated for water years 1950 through 2013 for 20 rivers and for water years 1930 through 2013 for 14 rivers draining to the GoM. DOC export was also estimated for the 21st century based on climate and hydrologic modeling in a previously published study. DOC export was calculated by using the regression model LOADEST to fit seasonally adjusted concentration discharge (C‐Q) relations. Our results are an analysis of the sensitivity of DOC export to changes in hydrologic conditions over time since land cover and vegetation were held constant over time. Despite large interannual variability, all rivers had increasing DOC export during winter and these trends were significant (
              p
               {\textless} 0.05) in 10 out of 20 rivers for 1950 to 2013 and in 13 out of 14 rivers for 1930 to 2013. All rivers also had increasing annual export of DOC although fewer trends were statistically significant than for winter export. Projections for DOC export during the 21st century were variable depending on the climate model and greenhouse gas emission scenario that affected future river discharge through effects on precipitation and evapotranspiration. The most consistent result was a significant increase in DOC export in winter in all model‐by‐emission scenarios. DOC export was projected to decrease during the summer in all model‐by‐emission scenarios, with statistically significant decreases in half of the scenarios.

            This study examines U.S. Northeast daily precipitation and extreme precipitation characteristics for the 1979–2008 period, focusing on daily station data. Seasonal and spatial distribution, time scale, and relation to large-scale factors are examined. Both parametric and nonparametric extreme definitions are considered, and the top 1\% of wet days is chosen as a balance between sample size and emphasis on tail distribution. The seasonal cycle of daily precipitation exhibits two distinct subregions: inland stations characterized by frequent precipitation that peaks in summer and coastal stations characterized by less frequent but more intense precipitation that peaks in late spring as well as early fall. For both subregions, the frequency of extreme precipitation is greatest in the warm season, while the intensity of extreme precipitation shows no distinct seasonal cycle. The majority of Northeast precipitation occurs as isolated 1-day events, while most extreme precipitation occurs on a single day embedded in 2–5-day precipitation events. On these extreme days, examination of hourly data shows that 3 h or less account for approximately 50\% of daily accumulation. Northeast station precipitation extremes are not particularly spatially cohesive: over 50\% of extreme events occur at single stations only, and 90\% occur at only 1–3 stations concurrently. The majority of extreme days (75\%–100\%) are related to extratropical storms, except during September, when more than 50\% of extremes are related to tropical storms. Storm tracks on extreme days are farther southwest and more clustered than for all storm-related precipitation days.},

The intellectual dominance of the efficient-market revolution has more been challenged by economists who stress psychological and behavorial elements of stock-price determination and by econometricians who argue that stock returns are, to a considerable extent, predictable. This survey examines the attacks on the efficient market hypothesis and the relationship between predictability and efficiency. I conclude that our stock markets are more efficient and less predictable than many recent academic papers would have us believe.},

The Gulf of Maine presents a test case of this paradigm, as temperatures have warmed extremely rapidly. Some species have shifted northeastward, matching predictions. Others—namely harmful algal species like Pseudo-nitzschia australis and Karenia mikimotoi—do not appear to have followed climate trajectories, arriving as surprises in the Gulf of Maine. Rare-biosphere dynamics offer one possible ecological lens for understanding and predicting this type of surprise. Rare species in the plankton, possibly more so than southerly ones, may provide management challenges in the future. Improved monitoring and broader coordination of monitoring of the rare biosphere could help develop early warning systems for harmful and toxic algae. A better theoretical understanding of rare biosphere dynamics is also needed. A challenge for the next cohort of ecosystem projections is to predict the newly emerging harmful species of the type that catch us by surprise.},

	abstract = {Ocean acidification (OA) is increasing predictably in the global ocean as rising levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide lead to higher oceanic concentrations of inorganic carbon. The Gulf of Maine (GOM) is a seasonally varying region of confluence for many processes that further affect the carbonate system including freshwater influences and high productivity, particularly near the coast where local processes impart a strong influence. Two main regions within the GOM currently experience carbonate conditions that are suboptimal for many organisms—the nearshore and subsurface deep shelf. OA trends over the past 15 years have been masked in the GOM by recent warming and changes to the regional circulation that locally supply more Gulf Stream waters. The region is home to many commercially important shellfish that are vulnerable to OA conditions, as well as to the human populations whose dependence on shellfish species in the fishery has continued to increase over the past decade. Through a review of the sensitivity of the regional marine ecosystem inhabitants, we identified a critical threshold of 1.5 for the aragonite saturation state (Ωa). A combination of regional high-resolution simulations that include coastal processes were used to project OA conditions for the GOM into 2050. By 2050, the Ωa declines everywhere in the GOM with most pronounced impacts near the coast, in subsurface waters, and associated with freshening. Under the RCP 8.5 projected climate scenario, the entire GOM will experience conditions below the critical Ωa threshold of 1.5 for most of the year by 2050. Despite these declines, the projected warming in the GOM imparts a partial compensatory effect to Ωa by elevating saturation states considerably above what would result from acidification alone and preserving some important fisheries locations, including much of Georges Bank, above the critical threshold.},

 from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Northeast Fisheries Science Center. The MAB (as defined by the shelf regions from Cape Hatteras to Cape Cod) experienced warming rates of 0.57 °C per decade during the Winter/Spring season (Jan–Apr) and 0.47 °C per
 decade during the Fall/Winter season (Sep–Dec). The GOM and GB, on the other hand, warmed at approximately half the rate of the MAB over the same time span (1977–2016). We found that rates of warming vary on decadal time scales. From 1977 to 1999, significant temperature increases

 variability in the Hudson River and Chesapeake Bay. However, decadal scale change in shelf salinity cannot be attributed to changes in river discharge as there were no significant decadal scale changes in river outflow. Variability in along-shelf freshwater transport and saline intrusions
 from offshore were the likely drivers of long-term changes in MAB shelf-salinity.},

            Delayed fishing fleet restructuring complicates the assessment of efficiency gains from individual transferable quota (ITQ) fisheries management programs. This article presents a methodology to estimate harvest sector efficiency gains in lieu of incomplete fleet restructuring. The methodology is applied to assess the efficiency gains in the Mid‐Atlantic surf clam and ocean quahog fishery ITQ program. While roughly 128 vessels harvested clams under the previous management regime, the analysis suggests that 21–25 vessels will remain under lTQs. The efficiency gains are estimated to be between \$@@‐@@11.1 million and \$@@‐@@12.8 million annually (1990 dollars).},

We then decompose the index to examine changes in technical efficiency, scale efficiency, and technical change. Our findings indicate that the ITQ system has not sustained gains in vessel productivity. These results are thought to be driven by spatial changes in biomass and the inability to access more productive fishing grounds.},

            Commercial fishing is a dangerous occupation despite decades of regulatory initiatives aimed at making it safer. We posit that the individual allocation of fishing quota can improve safety by solving many of the problems associated with the competitive race to fish, which manifest themselves in risky behavior such as fishing in poor weather. We present a previously unidentified approach to evaluation: estimating the change in the propensity to start a fishing trip in poor weather conditions as a result of the management change. We chronicle a revolution in risk-taking behavior by fishermen (a 79\% decrease in the annual average rate of fishing on high wind days) that is due to the change in economic incentives provided by rights-based management.

            Commercial fishing is a dangerous occupation despite decades of regulatory initiatives aimed at making it safer. We posit that rights-based fisheries management (the individual allocation of fishing quota to vessels or fishing entities, also called catch shares) can improve safety by solving many of the problems associated with the competitive race to fish experienced in fisheries around the world. The competitive nature of such fisheries results in risky behavior such as fishing in poor weather, overloading vessels with fishing gear, and neglecting maintenance. Although not necessarily intended to address safety issues, catch shares eliminate many of the economic incentives to fish as rapidly as possible. We develop a dataset and methods to empirically evaluate the effects of the adoption of catch shares management on a particularly risky type of behavior: the propensity to fish in stormy weather. After catch shares was implemented in an economically important US West Coast fishery, a fisherman’s probability of taking a fishing trip in high wind conditions decreased by 82\% compared with only 31\% in the former race to fish fishery. Overall, catch shares caused the average annual rate of fishing on high wind days to decrease by 79\%. These results are evidence that institutional changes can significantly reduce individual, voluntary risk exposure and result in safer fisheries.},

	abstract = {The Gulf of Maine has recently experienced its warmest 5-year period (2015–2020) in the instrumental record. This warming was associated with a decline in the signature subarctic zooplankton species, Calanus finmarchicus. The temperature changes have also led to impacts on commercial species such as Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) and American lobster (Homarus americanus) and protected species including Atlantic puffins (Fratercula arctica) and northern right whales (Eubalaena glacialis). The recent period also saw a decline in Atlantic herring (Clupea harengus) recruitment and an increase in novel harmful algal species, although these have not been attributed to the recent warming. Here, we use an ensemble of numerical ocean models to characterize expected ocean conditions in the middle of this century. Under the high CO2 emissions scenario (RCP8.5), the average temperature in the Gulf of Maine is expected to increase 1.1°C to 2.4°C relative to the 1976–2005 average. Surface salinity is expected to decrease, leading to enhanced water column stratification. These physical changes are likely to lead to additional declines in subarctic species including C. finmarchicus, American lobster, and Atlantic cod and an increase in temperate species. The ecosystem changes have already impacted human communities through altered delivery of ecosystem services derived from the marine environment. Continued warming is expected to lead to a loss of heritage, changes in culture, and the necessity for adaptation.},
